description: 'Lecture notes on Chapter 13: The Generation of Eddies by Instability.
  Topics include instability, buoyant convection, Rayleigh?Benard instability, convective
  adjustment and gravity wave breaking, reversal of mesopause temperature gradient,
  Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, radiating and growing solutions, instability of meteorological
  disturbances, baroclinic and barotropic instability, the Kelvin-Orr mechanism, two-level
  baroclinic model, baroclinic instability and climate, geometric stabilization, energetics
  of meteorological disturbances, and available potential energy.'
